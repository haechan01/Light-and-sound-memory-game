# Reflections about the light and sound memory game

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
   1. W3 schools- https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp: I learned about 
   2.  Stack overflow- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5836833/create-an-array-with-random-values: I learned how to create an array of random integers to generate a random pattern
   3. W3 schools- https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp: I used this website for different color names in css
   4. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Understanding and writing javaScript code was a little challenging at first because I have been mainly programming in Python for the last two years. Though the language was quite unfamiliar and I made syntax mistakes at first, I gained a better understanding of the language as I read the explanations and resources in the prework instructions. If I needed more intuition of how the code works, I looked through other online resources like stack overflow or w3schools to gain better understanding. For example, JavaScript Event was an unfamiliar topic for me, but learning about it on the w3website and implementing it to the website helped me understand different types of events and how JavaScript can react to user actions in HTML. As I learned about Java Script and created more functions for the memory game, I found it very intuitive and interesting. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
How does the front-end interact with the backend to store user data or bring up data from the backend to display it? Through this project, I was able to see the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which was very interesting. I want to learn more about how the data, such as the user records or data can be sent to data storage from the frontend. Another question I have is: what are the best practices for web design? To be specific, I want to learn about how to strategize for creating a good user experience by making design and feature choices. How do web developers determine the optimal number of features, animation, or even colors to create a 'better' website? I know that it would really depend on the contexts, but I am curious about the methods the professional developers take to iteratively improve it, such as peer or user feedback.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on the project, I would like to add score records of the user in the memory game. The score for a game will start from zero and increase by 1 whenever the user makes it to the next round. The score will be displayed above the buttons, and the final score will be written at the top right corner of the screen. This will make the game more interesting, and the user will be more motivated to get a higher score. Another feature that I would like to add is the user selection of difficulty level. There can be easy, medium, and hard modes where there will be more rounds with faster cues in the hard mode. This way, diverse people of different ages or memory levels can enjoy the game with a desirable difficulty.
